# Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) Module to Detect Mood Disorders

This project investigates the use of Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensors for emotional stress detection.  In its current stage, a prototype device has been developed to capture GSR data from a subject's palm. The data is then transmitted to a computer and displayed on a serial monitor.  Future development plans include:

Establishing thresholds to differentiate between various stress levels based on the collected data.
Implementing signal processing techniques to enhance data quality.
Integrating the device with a machine learning model to achieve more advanced stress detection and explore potential applications beyond mental health, such as manic disorders.
This project contributes to the exploration of GSR sensors as a potential tool for monitoring emotional states.
